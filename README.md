Hello! This is my active directory project!
Please see the outline below that I made using Draw.io !

## Goals and Objectives
**NOTE: I will be using Vultr's cloud computing service to setup all of my machines in this project**

1. Setup a Windows active directory
   - I will be using Windows Server 2022 (I had a lot of issues with Windows Server 2025 and had to switch to 2022)
   - This means I need to setup a test machine that acts as a regular user within the domain.
     - I also have to add this machine to my domain first which means setting up static ip addresses and network configurations for both machines.
  
2. Setup Splunk Enterprise within the local network using a Ubuntu machine
   - Requires downloading Splunk Universal Fowarder on both my Domain Controller and Test machines in order for them to properly connect.
   - Requires setting up a CLI Ubuntu machine first.
  
3.
